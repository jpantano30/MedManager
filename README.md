#### Unsolved Problems & Challenges

- **Authentication Issues:** Although users can successfully register and sign in, the app allows unauthenticated access, resulting in error displays when accessed without logging in.
- **Date Formatting:** Challenges encountered in formatting date information when communicating between the frontend and the backend.
- **API Result Formatting:** Difficulties in formatting the results retrieved from the interaction checker to make them more user-friendly.
- **CRUD Operations:** Challenges with fetch requests while managing CRUD operations for medications using the Django backend. Specifically, DELETE requests were not completing successfully, even though a 204 No Content response was received. This issue was resolved by using `response.text()` in the return statement instead of returning an empty object.
- **Deployment Issues:** Issues with deployment of the app to Heroku and Netlify. Prior to deployment the app worked but after I ran into many errors. The app currently works but if you try to open the Heroku deployed app, it will not load and responds with a 404 (Not Found).
